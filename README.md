# **Applied Data Science Capstone**
Welcome to my Applied Data Science Capstone project! As part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, this project is the culmination of my learning journey. It showcases my practical application of data science skills, including data analysis and machine learning. Feel free to explore the repository and gain insights into my capabilities. Thank you for checking it out! 

## **Introduction** 
SpaceX stands out as the leading company in the era of commercial space exploration, significantly reducing the cost of space travel. The company features Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, priced at 62 million dollars. In contrast, alternative providers charge over 165 million dollars for each launch. A substantial portion of the cost savings is attributed to SpaceX's innovative practice of reusing the initial rocket stage. Thus, the ability to predict the successful landing of the first stage becomes crucial in estimating the overall launch cost. Leveraging public information and advanced machine learning models, we aim to forecast whether SpaceX will opt to reuse the first stage in upcoming launches.

## **Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict the successful landing of the first stage in SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches. Given the significant cost savings associated with reusing the initial rocket stage, accurately forecasting whether SpaceX will reuse it in upcoming launches becomes pivotal in estimating overall launch costs. Leveraging public information and advanced machine learning models, I aim to provide valuable insights into the decision-making process of SpaceX regarding the reuse of the first stage.
